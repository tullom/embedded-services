# Copilot Instructions for embedded-services

## Overview

This is an embedded controller (EC) services workspace — a collection of `no_std` Rust crates implementing hardware-agnostic business logic for embedded controllers. Services glue together MCU HALs (via `embedded-hal` traits), peripheral drivers, and EC subsystem abstractions (sensors, batteries, fans, USB-PD, etc.) using the Embassy async runtime.

## Build, Test, and Lint

Toolchain: Rust 1.90 (`rust-toolchain.toml`), edition 2024. Targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (std/testing) and `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` (ARM Cortex-M33).

```shell
# Format
cargo fmt --check

# Lint (all feature combos, both targets)
cargo hack --feature-powerset --mutually-exclusive-features=log,defmt,defmt-timestamp-uptime clippy --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo hack --feature-powerset --mutually-exclusive-features=log,defmt,defmt-timestamp-uptime clippy --locked --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf

# Test (workspace, host target only)
cargo test --locked

# Test a single crate
cargo test --locked -p partition-manager

# Test a single test function
cargo test --locked -p partition-manager test_name

# Lint test code
cargo clippy --locked --tests

# Check docs
cargo doc --no-deps -F log --locked
cargo doc --no-deps -F defmt --locked

# Unused dependency check
cargo machete

# Dependency license/advisory/audit checks
cargo deny check --all-features --locked
cargo vet --locked
```

The `examples/` directory contains separate workspaces (excluded from the root workspace). Build/lint them independently:

```shell
# ARM board examples
cd examples/rt685s-evk && cargo clippy --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf --locked
cd examples/rt633 && cargo clippy --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf --locked
# Std examples
cd examples/std && cargo clippy --locked
```

## Architecture

> **Note:** The `v0.2.0` branch is the target for new development and
> contains the latest service patterns. Some services on `main` still
> use older patterns (e.g., `comms::Endpoint`, `MailboxDelegate`,
> `OnceLock` singletons) that are being phased out. When adding or
> modifying services, follow the patterns described below and on
> `v0.2.0`. See also [`docs/api-guidelines.md`](../docs/api-guidelines.md)
> for detailed rationale.

### Service Pattern

Services implement the `odp_service_common::runnable_service::Service<'hw>` trait, which enforces a consistent structure:

1. **`Resources`** — caller-allocated state (stored in a `StaticCell`), not an internal `OnceLock` singleton
2. **`Runner`** — implements `ServiceRunner` with a single `run(self) -> !` method that drives the service's async event loop
3. **`spawn_service!`** macro — handles boilerplate: allocates `Resources` in a `StaticCell`, invokes a caller-provided initialization closure, spawns the `Runner` on an Embassy executor

```rust
// Typical service using the Service trait
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Resources<'hw> {
    inner: Option<ServiceInner<'hw>>,
}

pub struct MyService<'hw> { /* control handle */ }
pub struct Runner<'hw> { /* holds refs into Resources */ }

impl<'hw> Service<'hw> for MyService<'hw> {
    type Resources = Resources<'hw>;
    type Runner = Runner<'hw>;
}

impl<'hw> MyService<'hw> {
    pub async fn new(
        resources: &'hw mut Resources<'hw>,
        params: MyInitParams<'hw>,
    ) -> Result<(Self, Runner<'hw>), MyError> {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Key principles (from API guidelines):

- **No `'static` references** — use generic `'hw` lifetimes for testability
- **External memory allocation** — callers provide `Resources`, no internal `static OnceLock` singletons
- **Trait-based public APIs** — runtime interfaces live in standalone `-interface` crates (e.g., `battery-service-interface`) for mockability and customizability

### Communication (IPC)

Services use a variety of async IPC mechanisms from `embassy-sync` and `embedded_services`:

- **`embassy_sync::channel::Channel`** — bounded async MPSC channels for command/response flows
- **`embassy_sync::signal::Signal`** — single-value async notifications
- **`embedded_services::ipc::deferred`** — request/response channels where the caller awaits a reply
- **`embedded_services::broadcaster`** — publish/subscribe pattern for event fan-out
- **`embedded_services::relay`** — relay service pattern for MCTP-based request/response dispatch with direct async calls

### Composition

At the top level, an EC is composed by spawning service tasks on an Embassy executor, using the `spawn_service!` macro:

```rust
let my_service = spawn_service!(
    spawner,
    MyService,
    |resources| MyService::new(resources, my_other_params),
)?;
```

### Core Utilities (embedded-service crate)

- **`GlobalRawMutex`**: `ThreadModeRawMutex` on ARM bare-metal, `CriticalSectionRawMutex` on RISC-V bare-metal and in tests/std
- **`SyncCell<T>`**: `ThreadModeCell` on ARM, `CriticalSectionCell` elsewhere — interior mutability for embedded

## Key Conventions

### `no_std` and Feature Flags

All service crates are `#![no_std]`. Logging is feature-gated with **mutually exclusive** features:

- `defmt` — embedded debug formatting (used on bare-metal targets)
- `log` — standard Rust logging (used on std targets / tests)

These must never be enabled simultaneously in production. Use the unified macros from `embedded_services::fmt` (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, `error!`) which dispatch to the correct backend.

### Error Handling

- Prefer custom `enum` error types per module — no `thiserror` (it requires std); some modules instead use lightweight struct error types when that is a better fit
- Prefer deriving `Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq` on error enums when practical (some errors may only derive a subset, e.g., `Debug`/`Copy`)
- Conditional defmt support: `#[cfg_attr(feature = "defmt", derive(defmt::Format))]`
- Result type aliases per module (e.g., `pub type BatteryResponse = Result<ContextResponse, ContextError>`)

### Clippy Configuration

The workspace enforces strict clippy lints (in root `Cargo.toml`). Key denials:

- `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `unreachable`, `unimplemented`, `todo` — no panicking in production code
- `indexing_slicing` — use `.get()` instead of `[]`
- Tests can relax these with `#[allow(clippy::panic)]`, `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]`

### Dependencies

- Workspace dependencies are centralized in root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`; member crates use `dep.workspace = true`
- Git dependencies from the OpenDevicePartnership GitHub org (embassy-imxrt, embedded-usb-pd, tps6699x, etc.)
- Feature-gated optional deps (`log`, `defmt`) should be listed in `[package.metadata.cargo-machete] ignored` to avoid false positives
- Supply chain security enforced via `cargo-vet` (config in `supply-chain/`) and `cargo-deny` (config in `deny.toml`)

### Testing

- Async unit tests in `no_std`/Embassy-focused crates use `embassy_futures::block_on(async { ... })` to stay runtime-agnostic
- Host-only async tests and integration tests may use `#[tokio::test]` in crates that depend on `tokio`
- Dev-dependencies enable `std` features: `embassy-sync/std`, `embassy-time/std`, `critical-section/std`
- `tokio` with `rt`, `macros`, `time` features is used to support `#[tokio::test]`-based host/integration tests
- Tests are organized in `#[cfg(test)]` modules or dedicated `test/` subdirectories

### Formatting

Max line width is 120 characters (`rustfmt.toml`).

### Commit Messages

Follow the [standard Git commit message conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html):

- Subject line: capitalized, 50 characters or less, imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body text at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*

### AI Attribution

Every commit that includes AI-generated or AI-assisted work **must** contain an `Assisted-by` trailer in the commit message:

```
Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION [TOOL1] [TOOL2]
```

Where:

- `AGENT_NAME` is the name of the AI tool or framework (e.g., `GitHub Copilot`)
- `MODEL_VERSION` is the specific model version used (e.g., `claude-opus-4.6`)
- `[TOOL1] [TOOL2]` are optional specialized analysis tools used (e.g., `coccinelle`, `sparse`, `smatch`, `clang-tidy`)

Basic development tools (git, cargo, editors) should not be listed.

AI agents **must** verify their own identity (agent name and model version) before composing the `Assisted-by` trailer — do not assume or hard-code a model name from a previous session.

AI agents **MUST NOT** add `Signed-off-by` tags. Only humans can certify the Developer Certificate of Origin.

## Rust PR Review Instructions
CI overview:
* CI will build the project and run `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`.
* Feature combinations are checked with `cargo hack`.
* Do not comment on compile errors, compiler warnings, or clippy warnings.

Pay special attention to...
* code that uses async selection APIs such as `select`, `selectN`, `select_array`, `select_slice`, or is marked with a drop safety comment. These functions drop the futures that don't finish. Check that values are not lost when this happens.
* code that could possibly panic or is marked with a panic safety comment.

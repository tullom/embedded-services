/// Debug service that bridges an internal endpoint to an external transport.
///
/// Terminology:
/// - Transport: The external-facing `comms::Endpoint` used to reach the host/PC.
///   It is provided by the platform (eSPI, USB, RTT bridge, etc.) and passed to
///   [`Service::new`]. Its ID is commonly `EndpointID::External(External::Host)`,
///   but the service does not assume a specific value.
/// - Endpoint: The internal endpoint owned by this service and registered under
///   `EndpointID::Internal(Internal::Debug)`. Messages addressed to this ID are
///   dispatched to the service via [`comms::MailboxDelegate::receive`].
///
/// Direction:
/// - Device → Host: Producers (e.g., the defmt forwarding task) should send from
///   `EndpointID::Internal(Internal::Debug)` to the transport endpoint ID exposed
///   by [`Service::endpoint_id`] or [`host_endpoint_id`].
/// - Host → Device: The platform transport should deliver host messages to
///   `EndpointID::Internal(Internal::Debug)`, which this service handles in
///   [`receive`](comms::MailboxDelegate::receive).
